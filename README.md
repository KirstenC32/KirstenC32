**Project 1**

***The purpose of project 1 is to utilize past data to make sales predictions using the CRISP-DM process***

*The following graph shows the various items and the count of those items sales. This gives insight in to what categories of items produce the most/least sales as well as providing quick visibility of our items popularity.*
